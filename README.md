d20-Dice-Calculator
===================

A dice calculator for any d20-based game, such as Dungeons and Dragons. Rolls all standard die: d3, d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100. Also, can be set to add up any number and combination of die, along with any constants.

For all the aspiring Dungeon Masters, professional dungeon crawlers, or the lil' tabletop newbies out there, this is for you. Trust us, rolling 40d6 seems fun at first, but after a few rounds you'll wish you had something to do all that rolling automatically, add it up, and spit out the simple amount of damage - something scarily similar to this intuitive and simplistic Android app.

A free app with no ads and low power consumption.
For the win.
